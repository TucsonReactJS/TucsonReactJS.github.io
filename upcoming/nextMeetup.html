    <p class="h3">Mashup: React-Router and Animation in React</p></a>
  <p>Monday, July 27, 2015 at 7:00pm
    <p>
      July's meetup will be two talks mashed together. Jason Hansen will be talking about using React-Router
      to manage state in your applications, which will lead nicely into Charlie King talking about different
      approaches for animation in React.
